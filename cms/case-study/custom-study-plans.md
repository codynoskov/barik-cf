    body: "W\uFEFFe went to whiteboarding and understood the types of study plans we can offer to our students. I went on and did a comic-alike stories, where I painted out 4 concepts of study plans to students. This conceptualized representation of ideas allowed us to test even before doing any prototypes of wireframes. So we immediately run these \"drawings\" through our students and got our answers. Isn't it a rapid prototyping? \n\n**Questions:**\n\n\\- whether users want to have their university or us to be involved in their study plans \n\n\\- how they want these study plans to be customized and in sync with their schedule \n\n\\- which sources they would like to have within their study plans\n\n**Answers:**\n\n\\- students wanted to customize their own plan\n\n\\- with smart AI recommendations."

We had to understand which data we need to ask our students beforehand in order to create a study plan for them. It was their subject of studies, end date, hours per day to study and some more.'

    body: 'Together with the UR department I conducted user interviews either as an interviewer or note taker. As an outcome from interviews **we usually have a deck with a detailed analysis** of the interviews and suggested further steps. We were thinking on how to make a study plan builder page, structure the landing page of the study plan. Another question was - how to show an everyday progress and an analysis for our students. We also tried to understand how to cheer them up in their studies and how to give them necessary recommendations down the way.'

    body: "**At the beginning w\uFEFFe didn't have a clear understanding of what we are solving.**\n\nW\uFEFFe've got a brief from our Business Unit, saying that our expansion to the US market must be supported by the design of our system. They pointed out that our US students are dropping out at the beginning of their journey and we need to figure out:\n\n\\- which problem they are facing after opening our system? (coming to a problem statement) \n\n\\- how to make them stay? (improving the retention)\n\nWe did an initial exploration of students pain points.\n\nFor that we used our knowledge base of user interviews and discussed possible students challenges with our User Research department. What was specifically useful – is to invite a couple of students to talk about their day-to-day issues in a form of free floating user interviews and to ask them to complete a couple of tasks within our system.\n\n**So which problem students facing during their trial period?**\n\n* They keep getting distracted and can’t find a structure. The pick-your-own-adventure path is cumbersome to figure out.\n* They are using some other resource. Our resource is good, but they are bounded to another and don’t feel like they want to change now.\n* They are super busy, not finding what they want really quick makes them abandon the resource.\n* Expectation mismatch - they wanted to have everything in one place and didn't see it in our case.\n\n**What are the potential solutions to increase users retention?**\n\n* Onboard users so they know how to use the platform to the fullest.\n* Motivate users with product copy, and gamification.\n* Make a structured plan for users (with their input). Then remind them to follow it.\n* Show progress over time, to show their movement towards a goal."

      For study plans we decided to have a soft launch for a small amount of existing users. We with UR wrote a couple of surveys to them.  
      Then we made an **A/B testing** for new and existing users to receive quantitative feedback.  
        
      **Outcomes were impressive**. We got lots of praise and positive feedback - together with wishes for further development.

    body: 'After discussing and answering the main questions we decided to bet on a **structured custom created study plan**. With this in mind I started to collect everything that I can find on the topic, such as any possible user interviews, hotjar activity and literature. I tried to find possible pain points while **observing users'' activity**. Also I made a **competitors’ analysis** - to see some common patterns on how people solved already existing problems. In parallel I’m always asking data analysts to provide possible findings related to the topic - **user activity, areas of churns, conversion** etc.'

      We collect and prioritise feedback from our users and we are making improvements based on this.  
      As a learning I would like to mention that, from trimming the feature too much we got to the point that we have to add an additional sprint to fix some obvious problems. Another learning is that we have to improve our communication between departments, our A/B test was moved for a week because of it. Also it seems like we could be better in drawing a real border between first phases (when we listen to feedback) and implementation phase.  
        
      Anyways it was a nice run, let’s do it again.
