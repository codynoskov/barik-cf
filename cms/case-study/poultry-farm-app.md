    f_header: Discovery
    f_range-number: 1.1
    f_layout: Left text small (grey)
    body: 'While observing trends in modern African agriculture, we realised that farmers document their business metrics and processes (e.g., expenses, production numbers) in copybooks that are not automated. They also predict their incomes based on previous experience alone. These practices are associated with a few problems. Firstly, relying on historical data makes it hard for new farmers to enter into the industry. Furthermore, farmers also have problems distributing their goods and buyers have a hard time finding good suppliers. How can we provide value to these farmers?'

      **Questions:  
      **How should the design project proceed?  
      What is the usual life-cycle of agricultural livestock (e.g, chickens)?  
      What tasks are associated with maintaining the farm?  
      What are the most important steps and variables in this process?  
      What features and experiences should be included in the first iteration?**  
        
      We answered these questions while drawing some initial flows and diagrams.**
