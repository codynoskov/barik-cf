    body: 'Wogibtswas is an app that helps people find cheap offers in supermarkets in Austria. Initially, we were concerned about the declining number of app downloads. Some old and new competitors seemed to offer something more attractive to our users. We wanted to delve deeper into competitor analysis and assess our features. We began with a brief competitor analysis and identified key performance indicators (KPIs). Due to confidentiality, I must blur the screens containing this information (also on some of the following pages).'

    body: 'Planning played a significant role here as it involved interdepartmental work. I took charge of creating a roadmap to ensure alignment within the team. This was the first big research for this company, so I wanted to be sure that we are all on the same page. Hiring our own users presented a challenge, as even the most active users were unreachable. After trying various approaches, we finally achieved full bookings list on Calendly.'

    body: 'In the roadmap, I mapped out the components for the research. Tickets were created for each component, with a dedicated person assigned to each task. Tasks for example included participant email correspondence, user recruitment, and outcome analysis—essential aspects that required careful attention. Particularly, we focused on crafting the interview scenario. We opted for semi-structured, contextual interviews with a test case. Additionally, conducting interviews entirely in German presented an opportunity for me, a non-native speaker, to overcome language barriers in the workplace.'

    body: 'We conducted six interviews, but at the beginning encountered a setback with approximately 70% of users failing to show up without prior notification. Despite this, we were fortunate to recruit users meeting the following criteria: heavy users and new users, individuals with mobile affinity/digital native tendencies, occasional bargain hunters, aged between 20-40 years. Interviews were conducted by two team members—one taking notes, the other asking questions. Interview lengths ranged from 45 to 60 minutes and were conducted in German, English, and Russian (upon one participant''s request).'

    body: 'Transcription proved to be a significant task, as the transcription app we tried failed. Consequently, we manually transcribed the interviews. We then collaboratively analyzed our notes to identify common patterns and cluster them. Findings were compiled into a single sheet, including participants'' answers and direct quotes, and then analyzed and filtered by topic.'

    body: 'We distilled the top nine findings from the interviews, breaking them down into observations and opportunities/solutions. These outputs were grouped into two larger categories, each dedicated to a specific department (Marketing and Product). Both departments needed to understand the prioritization of these outcomes. Voila!'
