    body: 'Initially, we explored suitable APIs for collections and wallets to meet our requirements. We compiled a list of necessary endpoints and thoroughly investigated each one through their respective APIs, understanding how to retrieve them. Some components proved more complex than anticipated, requiring custom calculations. I then took the list of endpoints into the design process.'

    body: 'We expanded our dashboard with additional components, adopting a broader approach. Throughout ideation phases, we experimented with adding and removing elements, considering various ideas. Ultimately, we chose to simplify interactions on the page, focusing only on the login flow and add/remove wallet functionality. This decision was intentional, recognizing the constraints of our deadline.'

    body: 'With consensus on design and data requirements from different APIs, I transitioned to the frontend. I refined designs, prepared code, and built components from scratch. Meanwhile, my colleagues focused on backend development and endpoints. Maintaining consistent naming conventions and delineating frontend and backend tasks were crucial.'

    body: 'A day before the deadline, we conducted a thorough status check. Results were not that optimistic, so we pointed out what is a must to have and what might be postponed after the release. Luckily we could’ve finished almost everything. However, calculating sales and sales floor on the frontend became a significant issue, only semi-resolved in the final stages of development.'

    body: "Completing this project provided an opportunity to delve deeper into the technical aspects of product development and gain a better understanding of the daily struggles faced by developers. I became a more proficient designer equipped with technical skills. While some believe that a technical background may constrain creativity, I discovered that it often provides a sense of direction and freedom. Throughout the course, I successfully learned frontend development, including various JavaScript and CSS tricks. Although I briefly considered changing my career path during the program (since the school was amazing), I ultimately realized that a developer's role isn't exactly I was looking for. However, leveraging my coding knowledge has become one of my strengths in my career journey.\n\nT\uFEFFhanks to amazing Nina and Sven for the teamwork!"
