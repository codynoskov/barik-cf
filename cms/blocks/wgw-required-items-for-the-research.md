In the roadmap, I mapped out the components for the research. Tickets were created for each component, with a dedicated person assigned to each task. Tasks for example included participant email correspondence, user recruitment, and outcome analysis—essential aspects that required careful attention. Particularly, we focused on crafting interview scenario. We opted for semi-structured, contextual interviews with a test case. Additionally, conducting interviews entirely in German presented an opportunity for me, a non-native speaker, to overcome language barriers in the workplace.
