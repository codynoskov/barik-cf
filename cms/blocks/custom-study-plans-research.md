After discussing and answering the main questions we decided to bet on a **structured custom created study plan**. With this in mind I started to collect everything that I can find on the topic, such as any possible user interviews, hotjar activity and literature. I tried to find possible pain points while **observing users' activity**. Also I made a **competitors’ analysis** - to see some common patterns on how people solved already existing problems. In parallel I’m always asking data analysts to provide possible findings related to the topic - **user activity, areas of churns, conversion** etc.
