For study plans we decided to have a soft launch for a small amount of existing users. We with UR wrote a couple of surveys to them.  
Then we made an **A/B testing** for new and existing users to receive quantitative feedback.  
  
**Outcomes were impressive**. We got lots of praise and positive feedback - together with wishes for further development.
