**So what stops users from using their subscription/trial?**

*   They keep getting distracted and can’t find a structure. The pick-your-own-adventure path is cumbersome to figure out.
*   They are using some other resource. Still want to do it, but want to do other things more.
*   Super busy, not able to make the time.
*   Expectation mismatch.

**What are the potential solutions to increase users activity?**

*   Onboard users so they know how to use the platform to the fullest.
*   Motivate users with product copy, and gamification.
*   Make a structured plan for users (with their input). Then remind them to follow it.
*   Show progress over time, to show their movement towards a goal.
