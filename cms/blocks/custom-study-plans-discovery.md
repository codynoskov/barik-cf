**At the beginning w﻿e didn't have a clear understanding of what we are solving.**

W﻿e've got a brief from our Business Unit, saying that our expansion to the US market must be supported by the design of our system. They pointed out that our US students are dropping out at the beginning of their journey and we need to figure out:

* which problem they are facing after opening our system? (coming to a problem statement)
* how to make them stay? (improving the retention)

We did an initial exploration of students pain points.

For that we used our knowledge base of user interviews and discussed possible students challenges with our User Research department. What was specifically useful – is to invite a couple of students to talk about their day-to-day issues in a form of free floating user interviews and asking them to complete a couple of task within our system. 

**So what stops students from using their subscription/trial?**

* They keep getting distracted and can’t find a structure. The pick-your-own-adventure path is cumbersome to figure out.
* They are using some other resource. Still want to do it, but want to do other things more.
* Super busy, not able to make the time.
* Expectation mismatch.

**What are the potential solutions to increase users activity?**

* Onboard users so they know how to use the platform to the fullest.
* Motivate users with product copy, and gamification.
* Make a structured plan for users (with their input). Then remind them to follow it.
* Show progress over time, to show their movement towards a goal.
