We recreated the experience of signing up and logging for users in our new market, “Rest of World” (non-US, non-Germany). At that time, I reshaped the style of our illustrations. Later on, we also completely rebuilt our platform’s performance analysis page, because the previous version was not understood by our users. Furthermore, we redesigned our dashboard for different user groups. Powering all of these changes were the insights we gathered from user research and platform experiments. The changes were later marketed, with my assistance, through several marketing campaigns to raise awareness and encourage adoption.
