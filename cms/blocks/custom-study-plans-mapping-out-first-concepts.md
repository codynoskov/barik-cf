On this stage I usually have a lot of back and forth with the PM, stakeholders and UR. We are **shaping the direction, cutting unnecessary corners, understanding the steps of the flow**. We had to understand which data we need to ask our students beforehand in order to create a study plan for them. It was their subject of studies, end date, hours per day to study and some more.
