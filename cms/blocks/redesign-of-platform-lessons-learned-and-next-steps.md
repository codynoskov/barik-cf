Despite all of the above we were able to ship a new platform in around two and a half years. Our section hired around 70 people during this time, ranging from devs and designers to top leadership, who I collaborated with in helping to shape our workflows. As a team, we learned how to work on a really fast growing project, and we also refined our design skills. The amount of experience we gained can not be put into numbers. And since we could make progress a lot more quickly after establishing teams and workflows, our teams continued to dive deep into different parts of the platform. My next contributions were oriented toward student-focused parts of the platform, where we improved and implemented features like ‘Custom study plans‘.
