After initial research and brainstorms were completed by our team lead and C-suite, we hired a UI designer who started painting out the wireframes. I supported the apps team, where we thought we could quickly make big progress and test the outcomes. At some point, however, we realized that we also needed to take some radical steps: completing the necessary coding before applying my prepared designs. At that point, I began to paint out our shop experiences for another team.
