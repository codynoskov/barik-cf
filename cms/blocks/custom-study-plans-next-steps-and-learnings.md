We collect and prioritise feedback from our users and we are making improvements based on this.  
As a learning I would like to mention that, from trimming the feature too much we got to the point that we have to add an additional sprint to fix some obvious problems. Another learning is that we have to improve our communication between departments, our A/B test was moved for a week because of it. Also it seems like we could be better in drawing a real border between first phases (when we listen to feedback) and implementation phase.  
  
Anyways it was a nice run, let’s do it again.
