While observing trends in modern African agriculture, we realised that farmers document their business metrics and processes (e.g., expenses, production numbers) in copybooks that are not automated. They also predict their incomes based on previous experience alone. These practices are associated with a few problems. Firstly, relying on historical data makes it hard for new farmers to enter into the industry. Furthermore, farmers also have problems distributing their goods and buyers have a hard time finding good suppliers. How can we provide value to these farmers?
