We conducted six interviews, but at the beginning encountered a setback with approximately 70% of users failing to show up without prior notification. Despite this, we were fortunate to recruit users meeting the following criteria: heavy users and new users, individuals with mobile affinity/digital native tendencies, occasional bargain hunters, aged between 20-40 years. Interviews were conducted by two team members—one taking notes, the other asking questions. Interview lengths ranged from 45 to 60 minutes and were conducted in German, English, and Russian (upon one participant's request).
