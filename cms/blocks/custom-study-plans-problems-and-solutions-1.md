**So which problem students facing during their trial period?**

* They keep getting distracted and can’t find a structure. The pick-your-own-adventure path is cumbersome to figure out.
* They are using some other resource. Our resource is good, but they are bounded to another and don’t feel like they want to change now.
* They are super busy, not finding what they want really quick makes them abandon the resource.
* Expectation mismatch - they wanted to have everything in one place and didn't see it in our case.

**What are the potential solutions to increase users retention?**

* Onboard users so they know how to use the platform to the fullest.
* Motivate users with product copy, and gamification.
* Make a structured plan for users (with their input). Then remind them to follow it.
* Show progress over time, to show their movement towards a goal.
