Planning played a significant role here as it involved interdepartmental work. I took charge of creating a roadmap to ensure alignment within the team. This was the first big research for this company, so I wanted to be sure that we are all on the same page. Hiring our own users presented a challenge, as even the most active users were unreachable. After trying various approaches, we finally achieved full bookings list on Calendly.
