As we approached completion, we encountered challenges but also made significant progress. The final improvements were implemented, all branches were pushed to the main repository. We extend our gratitude to our teachers' team for their invaluable assistance. Since this project was part of our school curriculum, we participated in a competition with judges and criteria. And guess, we’ve won! 🎉 Thanks to everyone involved!
