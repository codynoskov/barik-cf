**Questions:  
**How should the design project proceed?  
What is the usual life-cycle of agricultural livestock (e.g, chickens)?  
What tasks are associated with maintaining the farm?  
What are the most important steps and variables in this process?  
What features and experiences should be included in the first iteration?**  
  
We answered these questions while drawing some initial flows and diagrams.**
