From the outset, the most urgent problem we faced was entering a foreign market with an outdated platform design. Our challenge was not only to redraw the interface and upgrade the UX, but also develop a maintainable codebase as the previous version was outdated and could not support new features. Added difficulties included: time and human resource constraints, two unique platforms (German and US markets), multiple mobile-unfriendly apps (8), and a lack of experience within our team regarding agile practices, product management, and mobile design best practices. Looking back on it, I can see that we wouldn’t have been able to finish this project without hiring new people and constantly revising the way we worked together and implemented new tools.
